Technical Test for LineTen Interview

Decisions made:
- I made the class libraries .net8, if desired we could always use .netstandard or multi-target if these will be consumed elsewhere
- For the sake of time, I am opting to not leave class/method Documentation Comments
- Opted to use the older paradigm for services Program.cs due to static anaylsis issues with projet build
